In my hometown, we commonly serve Dongpo Pork, seafood, steamed fish, or something that symbolize good fortune and prosperity.\n36. Describe a problem in your city I live in Shenzhen, a vibrant and bustling metropolis. I think the biggest problem in my city is traffic congestion. During rush hours, the roads are often packed with cars, and public transportation tends to be overcrowded. I think this issue is mainly caused by the growing population and the increasing number of vehicles, as many people from all over the country come to Shenzhen for work. To address this issue, the government has introduced relavant policies, like restricting vehicle usage, adding more buses and metro lines, and promoting cycling to reduce the number of vehicles on the road.\n37. Are you optimistic that the situation will improve? Yeah, absolutely. I think the traffic congestion can be reduced significantly. With the implementation of smart city initiatives and autonmous driving technologies, transportation will become more efficient. Currently, the government is promoting AI-driven transportation in certain areas. Once the entire system is managed by AI, I’m confident traffic congestion will diminish in the future.\n38. Do you like the neighborhood that you live in? Yeah, I love it. It’s a beautiful place, and it’s by the river. Whenever I need to unplug from life, I just go for a jog along the river, it’s really restorative and calming.\n39. What’s your favorite sports team?

It’s a medium that really speaks to me, and I find it both entertaining and thought-provoking.\n41. Are open plan offices are good for productivity? Well, it depends on the nature of the work and the personal preferences of employees. For jobs that require a lot of collaboration, they can be highly effective. But for jobs that require deep concentration, I think a quieter room would be preferable. Personally, I prefer working in a quiet place, because I find it easy to get distracted in a noisy environment.\n42. Do you take public transportation or private transportation? Well, I moved to Shenzhen a few years age. The transportation here is very convenient. Compared to owning a car, I prefer public transportation, because I can’t stand the traffic confestion during rush hours. Additionally, taking public transportation also helps reduce carbon emissions.\n43. Is it easy to catch public transportation in your country? Yes, it’s quite easy and convenient. Especially in metropolis like Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen. These cities have extensive buses and metro network, and the cost is also very affordable.\n44.

The weather is generally pleasant during these times, neither too hot nor too cold, and destinations are commonly less crowded.\n45. Do you think that people pay attention to adverts on TV. I would say it depends. Some people may pay attention to TV ads if they find them relevant to their needs. But many others may skip or ignore them.

During this time, the weather is mild because my hometown is located in a subtropical region, and there are many local traditional customs and activities, and the fresh pomelo is really delicious.\n51-60 51. Is there anything you don’t like about your hometown? Well, overall, I really love my homwtown. It’s a beautiful and peaceful place. But, one downside is the lack of public transportation, which can be inconvenient, especially for the elderly who don’t drive.\n52. Is your hometown big or small? My hometown is relatively small. It’s a beautiful and peaceful place. It has all the essentials like schools, shops, and parks. It’s the kind of place where everyone knows each other.\n53. Does any one famous come from your hometown? Yes, one famous person from my hometown is Cheong Fatt Tze. He was a prominent businessman and philanthropist in the late 19th century. He made his fortune in the trading industry and played a key role in Penang’s development. His former residence has become a historic landmark and a popular tourist destination in Malaysia.\n54. Could you describe the landscape of your hometown? My hometown, Meizhou, is located in Guangdong Province. It’s surrounded by lush green mountains. The rolling hills and verdant forests create a peaceful and picturesque environment. The city is also known for its rivers, and there are many parks and natural reserves, making it a great palce for outdoor activities like hiking and sightseeing.\n55. What is some of the history of your hometown? My hometown, Meizhou, was established during the Tang Dynasty. It became a hub for the Hakka people and is considered the cultural heart of Hakka heritage. The city played a significant role in agriculture, particularly in rice and tea cultivation. Meizhou is also renowned for its historical architecture, such as the Circular Dragon houses, which are oval-shaped, and typically surrounded by living quarters and a pond.\n56. What’s the best thing about your hometown? The best thing about my hometown is the food. I always get excited when there’s a local event because it means I can enjoy my favorite dish, Dongpo Pork. It’s slow-cooked with soy sauce, sugar, and spices. It literally melts in your mouth. I really love it.\n57. How do you think your hometwon will change in the future? I think my hometown will continue to modernize in the future. Actually, the government has been building a high-speed rail line recently, and there will likely be more investment in infrastructure and public services. It will be more convenient than before. But I hope the local culture and traditions will be preserved alongside this development.\n58. How long have you lived in your hometown? Well, I come from Meizhou, I was born and raised there. I lived there for 20 odd years, and then moved to Shenzhen. But I always return during holidays.\n59. Do you like your hometown? Yeah. I do love my hometown. It holds a lot of cherished memories for me. It’s a peaceful and beautiful place. The people are friendly, and there’s a strong sense of community.\n60. Would you rather live in your hometown or another city? I would say it depends. For work, I prefer to live in a city, as it offers more career opportunities and amenities. But, for a more relaxed life, I would choose my hometown, because I feel it is more at ease and connected.\n61-70 61. What’s the difference between your hometown and other cities in your country? In my opinion, the main difference between them is the pace of life. My hometown is much more peaceful and comfortable. The people are friendly, and there’s a strong sense of community. In contrast, bigger cities tend to be more modern, bustling, and crowded, offering more job opportunities. But the pace of life there is much faster, especially on busy days.\n62. Which is more important, educational qualifications or work experience? I would say it depends. Educational qualifications provide a strong foundation of knowledg and skills, especially in specialized fields. They can open doors to many job opportunities. On the other hand, work experience is also crucial, because it demonstrates practical skills and problem-solving abilities, and these abilities are very improtant in real-world situations, especially in technical fields.\n63. Do you think artificial intelligence will ever replace teachers in the classrooms? Well, I don’t think AI will replace teachers. I believe AI can be a great tool to assist with learning, but it can’t provide something like human connection and empathy. Besides, teachers also play a key role in fostering creativity, critical thinking, and social skills. So, I believe AI will enhance the learning experience but it won’t replace teachers.\n64. Should students be allowed to use AI to help them with their homework? I think it’s okay. Because AI can provide valuable asistance, like offering explanations and suggesting ideas. But it shouldn’t replace the process of learning. Students shouldn’t use AI to simply complete tasks, they should view it as a supporting tool instead of a shortcut.\n65. Could you speculate on how cities will develop in the future? Well, in the future, with the help of AI, I think cities will become smarter. Transportation could be transformed with autonomous cars and even flying taxis, and we might see many unmanned aerial vehicles in the sky. Buildings might become more eco-friendly, with green roofs and integrated renewable energy sources.\n66. Could you describe how noticeable the gap between the rich and the poor is in your country? Well, in China, the gap between the rich and the poor is quite noticeable. In metropolis like Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, local residents enjoy better healthcare and educational resources. But, in some rural areas, many people even do not have health insurance, and if they face serious illnesses, they have to wait for the worst. Besides, the income gap has widened, and low-income people often struggle to keep up with the development in urban areas.\n67. How worried are you about rising world temperatures? Well, the effects of global warming are alreay becoming apparent, such as extreme weather events like El Niño. Many places around the world are facing more frequent heatwaves, hurricanes, and flooding. This not only threatens the environment but also may pose serious diseases. So, we must strive to live in harmony with our nature.\n68. Do you think young people are becoming less and less hard-working? I don’t think so. But, their approach to work has changed a lot compared to previous generations. Many young people today are driven by their passion and interests, and they tend to seek a better work-life balance, which can sometimes be seen as a lack of hard work. At the same time, the rise of technology has made it easier to work efficiently, but they are still working hard, just in a different context.\n69. Is your home in a convenient location? Yeah, it’s near public transportation, there are bus stops and a metro station just a short walk away, so commuting to work is quite convenient. And, there are several shops, restaurants, and other essential services nearby, so it’s easy to buy daily necessities.\n70. What is your city famous for? I live in Shenzhen. It’s famous for being a major hub of technology and innovation. It’s often referred to as China’s “Silicon Valley”. It’s the home to some of the big tech companies, like Huawei and Tencent. Additionaly, Shenzhen is also known for its cultural diversity, because it’s a young city, and there are many people from all over the country come to shenzhen for work.\n71-80 71. What would you like to change about your city? One thing I want to change about Shenzhen is the traffic congestion. The number of cars on the road has increased significantly over the years, as many people from all over the country come to shenzhen for work. I think adding more buses and metro lines could alleviate this issue.\n72. How can you make your city better? I think improving public transportation would make our city better. Although Shenzhen already has a good transportation system, expanding the transportation network could reduce traffic congestion and make commuting more convenient for everyone.\n73. What should a tourist do if they visit your country? Well, if they are interested in Chinese culture, they should visit iconic landmarks like the Great Wall, the Forbidden City in Beijing, and the Terracotta Army in Xi’an. For those curious about nature and ancient towns, I would recommend Yunnan, especially places like Lijiang and Dali. If they want to experience modern China, Shanghai, Shenzhen are great options, where they’ll find cutting-edge architecture, vibrant shopping districts, and lively nightlife.\n74. What are the main industries in your city? Well, Shenzhen is a city with a highly diverse economy. It’s often referred as China’s Sillicon Valley. It’s the home to some of the big tech companies, like Huawei and Tancent. Shenzhen is also a significant financial center in China, there are many banks, investment firms, and insurance companies. Additionally, the city has a strong manufacturing sector, particularly in electronics and high-tech products like smartphones and computer components.\n75. What kinds of amenities does your city offer? Shenzhen offers a wide range of amenities. It has a highly efficient transportation network, including buses, taxis, and metro lines. The city also has many shoping malls like Mixc Mall and COCO Park. There are many entertainment options, including restaurants, cinemas, and nightlife scenes. Additionally, Shenzhen has modern hospitals and high standard healthcare facilities.\n76. Do you think that many public holidays are losing their significance nowadays? Yeah, I totally agree. One reason is that, nowadays, people are often busy with work, and they may need to travel to different cities for their jobs, making it difficult to truly celebrate holidays. Additionally, holidays have become somewhat commercialized, people focus more on shopping, rather than on the cultural or historical significance of holidays.\n77. How has your city has developed over the past few decades? Well, Shenzhen has experienced tremendous development over the past few decades. At first, it was a small fishing village. In the 1980s, it became a Special Economic Zone. Now, it has grown into a bustling metropolis. There are many skyscrapers, and it’s often referred as China’s Sillicon Valley, it’s the home to some of the big tech companys, like Huawei and Tencent.

The country also has many major rivers, like the Yangtze and the Yellow River, which are crucial for both agriculture and transportation.\n80. What some social issues does your country have? The first one is income inequality. China has experienced rapid economic growth, the wealth gap between urban and rural areas has widened, and many people come to cities for work often struggle to keep up with the development.

Air pollution is also a significant issue, because it affects public health and quality of life.\n81-90 81. What are some global issues? One major issue is climate change. It’s leading to extreme weather events, like El Niño, and many places around the world are facing more frequent heatwaves, hurricanes, and flooding. Another issue is wealth inequality. Many countries in Africa face shortages of food and education, while developed Western nations have an abundance of food. The last is the ongoing conflicts and wars, such as those in Ukraine and Middle East.\n82. What can you do to make the world a better place to live? Well, personally, I try to reduce my carbon footprint by using public transportation more often. I believe the root of poverty is a lack of education, so supporting educational resources in underserved countries could help break the cycle of poverty. Lastly, spreading kindness and understanding, and encouraging others to do the same, can help create a more compassionate world for everyone.\n83. What’s the standard of living like in your country? Well, it depends on the areas. In metropolis like Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, the standard of living is higher, there are convenient transportation and high standard halthcare systems. Cities offer more job oppotunities and higher salaries. In contrast, rural areas tend to have a lower standard of living, there are fewer job opportunities and lower salaries compared to the cities, but the cost of living is also more affordable.\n84. How can you improve your quality of life? Well, I exercise regularly, when I need to unplug from life, I like to go for a jog outside. I eat really healthily and rarely have drunk food, may be once or twice a month. I also try to get enough sleep, usually around 7 to 9 hours a night. And before bed, I medidate for about 15 minutes to clear my mind. When I’m feeling stressd, I like to listen to instrumental music, like piano or violin.\n85. Describe where you would like to retire. I would like to live in Dali when I retire. It’s a beautiful and peaceful place in Yunnan Province. It’s surrounded by stunning natural scenery, there are a lot of lush mountains and waterfalls. The weather is mild year-round, making it a perfect spot for a comfortable retirement. Dali also has a rich cultural history, featuring ancient towns, temples, and vibrant local markets.\n86. Describe a famous place in your country. Well, one of the famous place in China is the Forbidden City, it’s located in Beijing. It was the imperial palace for over 500 years, it’s the home of Chinese emperors from the Ming to the Qing dynasties. The palace complex is massive, its architecture is an example of traditional Chinese design, there are beautiful wooden structures, golden roofs, and intricate carvings. Today, it’s a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a popular tourist destination, many visitors from all over the world come to Beijing to explore its rich history and cultural significance.\n87.

Dali also has a rich cultural history, featuring ancient towns, temples, and vibrant local markets.\n88. Is the government doing enough to raise the standard of living? Yeah. the government has made significant efforts to raise the standard of living. Actually, the government has been building a high-speed rail line in my hometown recently, and there will likely be more investment in infrastructure and public services. It will be more convenient than before. Additionaly, the government also provides free health check-ups for the elderly. For those who with serious illnesses, the government covers part of medical expenses.\n89. How does a city shape who you are or become? Well, the pace of life in Shenzhen is fast, which has taught me to be adaptable and focused. There are people from all over the country, so I’m exposed to a variety of ideas and lifestyles, making me more open-minded.\n90. Which is more important, raising the standard of living or protecting the environment? Well, I think sustainable development would be more important. If we only focus on economic growth, it can lead to issues like pollution and resource depletion. If we balance both economic growth and enviomental protection, it will support a higher quality of life in the long run.\n91-100 91. What factors determine a country’s standard of living? One key factor is the economic situation, including GDP and income levels, as these affect people’s purchasing power. Access to high-quality healthcare and education systems is also crucial. Infrastructure, such as public transportation and communication networks, makes people’s lives more convenient. Environmental factors like air quality, clean water, and green spaces also have a significant impact on people’s satisfaction.\n92. What role does the UN play?

It also addresses global challenges such as poverty, climate change, and health crises.\n93. Do you think the world becoming smaller? Yeah, I think the world is becoming smaller. With advancements in technology, it’s easier than ever to connect with people from all over the world. Actually, when I was preparing for my IELTS exam, I practiced my spoken English with people from various countries. I made some friends from places like Vietnam, Bangladesh, Russia, Japan, and Malaysia.\n94. What are the major differences between your country and other nations? Well, China places a strong emphasis on collectivism, where family and community are highly valued, but many western countries focus more on individualism. China is a large and diverse country, it has various regional cuisines, and when we sit down to eat, we commonly share food, but other countries like the U.S., typically don’t have the tradition of sharing food.\n95. What can you learn from other countries and cultures? Well, actually, I’ve been learning about Japan recently. The Japanese are very dedicated to their work and have a strong respect for nature. The streets are always clean, and people are known for being friendly and polite. Japanese also embraces minimalism and organization, they enjoy simple and focused life.\n96. How have cities in your country developed since your parents were young? Well, back then, my city was smaller, with limited infreastructure and fewer modern amenities. Over the years, the city has developed rapidly, there are high-speed rail, subways, and buses, making daily life more convenient. Modern buildings have replaced old houses, and there are many shopping malls and entertainment centers.\n97. What will cities be like in the future? In the future, cities will become smarter. Public transportation will be controlled by AI, with autonomous cars, unmanned aerial vehicles, and even flying taxis. Buildings will become more eco-friendly, featuring green roofs and integrated renewable energy sources.\n98. What is the cause of urbanisation? I think the cause of urbanization is driven by the desire for a better life. People tend to move to urban areas to find a better job and make more money. Additionaly, the convenient transportation and high standard healthcare service also attract people to the urban area. Over time, the urban area expand to accommodate the growing population, leading to further urbanization.\n99. What is the downside of urbanisation? One issue of urbanization is overpopulation, which puts excessive pressure on resources like housing, transportation, and healthcare. Another concern is environmental degradation, as growing traffic can lead to air pollution. Additionally, inefficient housing can result in the loss of green spaces. Urbanization also create social inequality, widening the gap between the rich and the poor.\n100. How is overpopulation caused? I think the key factor behind overpopulation is migration. Many people from all over the country come to cities for work, as cities offer more job opportunities and higher salaries. Additionally, the convenient transportation and high standard healthcare seivices also attract people to cities, which can lead to overpopulation.\n",

On the other hand, work experience is also crucial, because it demonstrates practical skills and problem-solving abilities, and these abilities are very improtant in real-world situations, especially in technical fields.</p>
