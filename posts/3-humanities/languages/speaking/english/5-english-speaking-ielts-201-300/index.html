  "articleBody": "201-210 201. Do you think it’s better to learn in a coeducational or single sex school? Well, definitely the coed school. Because in a coed environment, students have the opportunity to interact with peers of both genders, it’s helpful to develop their social skills. Single-sex schools might provide a more focused learning environment, but life is not just about acquiring book knowledge, is about learning a wide range of things.\n202. What’s the best way to punish students if they have broken a school rule? Well, to address rule-breaking in schools, we should focus on education. It’s important to help students understand the consequences of their actions, make them aware of the responsibility they hold when taking actions, and teach them what is cannot be tolerated.\n203. What are the advantages and disavantages of school uniforms? Well, the pros of school uniforms include reducing visible differences in socioeconomic status, help to prevent peer pressure related to clothing. Uniforms can also create a sense of school identity, fostering displine and minimizing distractions in the classroom. The cons include limiting students’ freedom of expression and individuality. It also may affect students’ self-esteem to some extent.\n204. Would you aggree that exams are the best way to measure what a student has learnt. I would say no. Because I think exams are a common way to measure what a student has learnt. they mainly evaluate a student’s ability to recall information, but they can’t capture other important aspects of learning, such as project-based work, presentations, and teamwork, which are essential for a more well-rounded evaluation.\n205. Which subjects at school are becoming increasingly important? Well, subjects that focus on developing critical thinking skills are becoming increasingly important, typically include Science, Mathematics, and Logic. Additionally, subjects like foreign languages are becoming more valuable in our interconnected world, as they help students communicate and collaborate with people from all over the world.\n206. How has education changed over the past 50 years in your country? Well, the biggest shift has been the increased use of electronical and technical devices in teaching. In the past, education relies heavily on traditional methods, such as textbooks and chalkboards, but now, digital tools like computer, tablets and online resources have become integral to the learning process. Another major change is the emphasis on developing soft skills, such as critical thinking, creativity, and collaboration.\n207. How will education will change in the future? Well, in the future, education is likely to become more personalized and technology-driven. AI will play a significant role as a supportive tool in the learning process. The role of teachers may evolve from traditional lecturers to facilitators, guiding students through interactive projects and collaborative work. Additionally, the boundaries of education will likely expand beyond the classroom, lifelong learning will become the norm.\n208. Describe a school rule that you don’t like or disagree with? One school rule I don’t like is the strict dress code. While it may help create a more focused learning environment, it limits students’ freedom of expression and individuality. Additionally, An overly strict dress code could also affect students’ self-esteem to some extent.\n209. Describe what crimes affect the area you live in. Well, I rarely hear about crimes in my community. Some common incidents might inculde theft, such as stealing electric bicycles. In recent years, as the economic situation has not been very good, there have been cases where some unemployed people resort to social retaliation out of frustration.\n210. Describe what makes a good police officer. Well, I think a good police officer should have strong communication skills, because this allow them to build trust with the commnunity. They should also have a sense of fairness, and treat everyone with respect. Additonally, a good police officer should be physically fit, mentally sharp, and able to make quick and sound decisions under pressure.\n211-220 211. Describe a crime that you have heard about. Well, I’ve heard about some fraud cases from people around me. About two years ago, telecom fraud was really rampant, and my friend’s cousin was scammed out of 20,000 yuan.\n212. How have crimes changed over the last 50 years in your country? Well, in the past, traditional crimes like theft and robbery were more prevalent. But now mobile payments in China are really popular, we rarely use cash for our daily transactions, so robbery crime have nearly disappeared. Additionaly, the survailance cameras are everywhere, which contribute to a decrease in theft cases. But the telocom crime has become more rampant these years, and it’s difficult to solve because the criminals are often based aboroad, particularly in countries like Myanmar and the Philippines.\n213. How will crimes will change in the future? Well, I think telecom fraud will become more rampant as the world becomes more interconnected, and it’s harder to solve multinational crimes. Additionaly, money laundering could become more widespread, as criminals may use cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to facilitate illegal activities.\n214. Why do people become criminals? Well, I think one major reason is economic hardship. When people are struggling with poverty or unemployment, they might resort to crime to improve their financial situation. Additionally, people who lack education are more likely to commit crimes.\n215. Is it possible to change a criminal into a law-abiding citizen? Yeah, I think it’s possible. We can help former criminals build new life skills and a sense of belonging in society. People can change if they get the right support. With help from family and the community, many people can turn their lives around.\n216. Do you think there is link between drugs and crime? Yeah, I do think there is link between drugs and crime. Many crimes are related to drug use or drug trafficking. For example, people may commit crime to feed their addiction, and drug dealers may be involved in organized violent crimes as part of their illegal business.\n217. What do you think of gambling? Well, for some people, gambling can be an enjoyable social activity. But for others, gambling can lead to addiction, financial ruin, and even criminal behavior.\n218. What can you do in the evening? Well, in the evening, I usually read books at home. Actually, I’ve been rereading the little prince in English recently. I get new insights everytime I read it. I also love watching movies and TV shows. Additionaly, meditation is also my daily routine, I meditate 15 minutes before bed to clear my mind.\n219. Do you enjoy dancing? Well, I don’t know about dancing, to be honest. But I’d love to learn if someone’s willing to teach me. I’m really into staying healthy, and dancing is great for that.\n220. Have you ever tried Karaoke? Yeah. I live in Shenzhen for work. During holoidays, I always return my hometown to celebrate with my family. We usually go to karaoke, and I really enjoy it.\n221-230 221. Do you know any amusement parks? Yeah, I completed my education in Guangzhou, and I’ve been to Chimelong with my friends. It has a lot of attractions, like the Ocean Kingdom, the Safari Park, and the Resort area. I particularly love the Safari Park because I’m really into animals.\n222. What’s the best museum or art gallery? Well, I seldom go to museums or art galleries. But I’ve been to the China Hakka Museum in Meizhou. Inside, you can see a lot of agricultural tools, because Meizhou plays a significant role in agriculture, especially in rice and tea. You can also see traditonal Hakka architecture models and other cultural artifacts like clothing and pottery. I think the best part of museums is that by appreciating these artifacts, you can give a glimpse into their way of life over the centuries.\n223. Which form of entertainment do you enjoy the most? I’d say I enjoy watching movies the most. It’s a great way to unwind. I love how films can tell powerful stories through visual imagery, music, and performance. I also enjoy exploring how directors use cinematography to convey emotions and ideas. It’s a medium that really speaks to me, and I find it both entertaining and thought-provoking.\n224. Do you think movie stars and actors earn too much money? It’s hard to say, to be honest. Movie stars and actors work really hard, and their jobs involve a lot of pressure and long hours. But at the same time, I think the money they make is often way higher than most people earn.\n225. How much influence do celebrities have on youngsters? Well, Celebrities have a big influence on youngsters. A lot of them look up to movie stars and try to imitate their style or even lifestyle choices. Sometimes it’s positive, like promoting fitness, but it can also have negative effects like setting unrealistic expectations or encouraging unhealthy habits.\n226. What are the disadvantages of fame and success? Well, one big disadvantage is the lack of privacy. Celebrities often have their lives under the spotlight, which can be exhausting and stressful. Additionally, because of anonymity, there are full of simps who can ruin their day by sending unpleasant messages.\n227. Which is most important to you, fame, success, or wealth? I don’t really want to be famous, to be honest, as I enjoy peaceful life. I think doing something meaningful and feeling accomplished is far more important than chasing fame or money.\n228. Why are we so interested in the private lives of celebrities? I think it’s because celebrities are often seen as larger-than-life figures, and it feels like a way to connect with them. Sometimes, their lives seem so different from ours, which sparks our curiosity. It’s a mix of fascination and maybe even envy.\n229. What responsibilities do famous people have to society and children in particular? I think celebrities have a responsibility to set a good example, especially for youngsters. Because their actions can influence how yonger generations think and behave. They can use their platform to make a positive difference.\n230. Should movies be censored? Well, I think movies should be regulated, but not heavily censored. When it comes to things like violence or racial discrimination, some viewers, particlarly youngsters, might not be able to handle it, but too much censorship can limit artistic expression. So it’s important to strike a balance between freedom of expression and ensuring that content is apporaciate.\n231-240 231. Are you afraid of bugs? 232. Do you like watching animals in the wild? 233.

<p>Well, definitely the coed school. Because in a coed environment, students have the opportunity to interact with peers of both genders, it&rsquo;s helpful to develop their social skills.

<p>I would say no.
