They also think about the location of the university. In China, many people prefer universities in big cities like Beijing, Shanghai or Shenzhen because these cities offer more job opportunities after graduation, and they often plan their career paths around staying these major hubs.\n302. How important is a tertiary education in getting a job in your country? Well, in fields like technology, finance, or medicine, tertiary education is often a basic requirement in job hunting. Because it shows you have specialized knowledge and competence for the job. But, in recent years, there’s growing focus on skills and practical experience, especially in industries like IT.\n303. What do you think of the saying “Experience is the best teacher”? Well, it’s quite true, especially in computer science, if you want to work in the Internet field, then you have to get your hands dirty. I think experience can help you understand things on a deeper level because you’re dealing with challenges, making mistakes, and figuring out how to solve problems.\n304. Is your hometown a safety city? Yeah, my hometown is a pretty safe city. The crime rate is relatively low, and people generally feel comfortable walking around, even at night. Surveillance cameras are everywhere, where helps reduce theft, and the mobile payment is so popular in China that robberies have almost disppeared. But in some rural areas, there are still occasional cases of farm animals being stolen.\n305. Are there any parts of your city that are too dangerous to visit? Well, not really, my city is generally quite safe. There aren’t any areas that are considered too dangerous to visit. I would say, like any city, be cautious in less crowded places at night.\n306. Is it safe to walk outside alone at night? Yes, it’s generally safe to walk outside alone at night in my city. The streets are well-lit, and surveillance cameras are everywhere. But, in recent years, the economic situation hasn’t been very well, there are some isolated cases of unemployed indiciduals causing trouble out of frustration, but these incidents are extremely rare.\n307. Do you always lock your house and car? Yeah, I always lock my house and car. It’s more about being cautious than feeling unsafe. Even though my city is generally safe, it’s just a good habit to prvent any potential issues. Better safe than sorry!\n308. Could you compare blue-to white-collar crime? Well, blue-collar crime usually involves physical actions like theft or burglary, while white-collar crime is more about financial offenses, like fraud or insider trading. They are both harmful, but blue-collar crimes are typically easier to spot, while white-collar crimes can be more complex and harder to detect.\n309. Do you think abortion is a crime? Well, I think abortion is a crime because there are ways to prevent unwanted pregnancies, like using contraception. If an unexpected preganancy happens, I see it as gift from God. It may bring financial pressure, but it also brings joy and a sense of purpose. As humans, I believe we have a responsibility to embrace life and care for it.\n310. How concerned are you about terrorism? Well, I’m not overly concerned about terrorism because my country is generally quite safe. But I think it’s important to understand the impact terrorism has on some parts of the world. It’s something that governments and societies need to address together.\n311-320 311. Are you optimistic that in the future we will be living in a safer society? Yeah, I’m optimistic that we’ll be living in a safer society. In the future, with better surveillance systems, I think governments and communities will be able to prevent many crimes and address security issues more effectively.\n312. What are the characteristics of gangs in your country? Well, gangs are relatively uncommon in my country. But I’ve seen gangs in the movie, they are often involved in activities like illegal gambling or drug dealing. These gangs operate with strict rules and sometimes have informants within the police office.\n313. How could the government improve public safety in your country? Well, the government could improve public safety by increasing police patrols in areas where crime is more common. They can also educating citizens about safety measures, like emergency preparedness or online security. Additionally, addressing social issues like unemployment or poverty would help reduce crime rates in the long term.\n314. What rights should criminals have while in jail? Well, I think criminals should still have basic human rights while in jail, such as access to food, clean water, healthcare, and safety. They should also have the opportunity to improve themselves through education. At the same time, their rights like freedom of communication should be limited.\n315. How effective are the police in your country in preventing crime? Well, I’d say generally effective, especially in urban areas where they have better resources and surveillance systems. They’re usually quick to respond to incidents and have a good presence in high-crime areas.\n316. Where do you like to read? Well, since I’m working now, I usually read in my bedroom. But back in my school days, I loved going to the library to read. I really enjoyed the warm and cozy atmosphere there—it was the perfect place to focus and get lost in a book.\n317. What genre of books don’t you like? I’m not really a fan of horror books. I prefer stories with more positive or thoughtful themes, like personal growth, or inspiring stories. I enjoy books that make me reflect or offer a sense of hope and positivity.\n318. Do you ever read English books or magazines? Yeah, I read English books from time to time. I find it a good way to improve my language skills and expand my vocabulary. I’m a software engineer, so I mostly read books on topics related to Computer Science.\n319. Which star would you like to meet? Well, if I had the chance, I’d love to meet Arnold Schwarzenegger. He’s not only reach for his success in acting but also for his achievements in bodybuilding, business, and politics. I admire his determination and how he’s constantly reinvented himself throughout his career. I think it would be amazing to hear his stories and advice in person.\n320. Who’s a famous actor/singer from your country? Jay Chou is a very famous singer from my country. He’s known as the “King of Mandopop” and has been a hugh influence on Chinese music for years. His unique style blends traditional Chinese elements with modern pop. I really admire his talent for songwriting and composing, and his songs are classics for many people in my generation.\n321-330 321. What kind of star would you like to be? Well, to be honest, I don’t want to famous, I prefer a peaceful life. But if I had to choose, I’d love to be a star who inspires others to do good, like someone who raises awareness about socual issues using their platform.\n322. What effect, if any, does violence on TV and movies have on children? Well, I think violence in media can desensitize children to real-world violence, making it seem less serious or even acceptable. It might also make them more likely to act aggressively or imitate what they see especially if they don’t fully understand the consequences of those actions.\n323. How serious is the problem of pirated movies in your country? Well, in my country, pirated movies are still available online, and a lot of people continue to watch them, because they’re free and more convenient.\n324. What are the main causes of pollution in your area? Well, in my area, the main causes of pollution include industrial emissions and traffic. There are a lot of factories around, and their emissions contribute significantly to air pollution. Traffic is another big issue, especially during rush hour, as the number of vehicles has been steadily increasing, leading to more exhaust fumes and smog.\n325. How concerned are you about the environment? Well, I’m pretty concerned about the environment, especially with all the issues like climate change and pollution. The extreme weather events are becoming more obvious every year. I try to do my part by being more mindful of things like reducing waste and recycling. But I think we all need to take responsibility because these problems affect everyone.\n326. How noticeable is the problem of deforestation in your country? Well, in the past, the government focused on the development of economy, the problem of deforestation in my country is quite serious, especially in certain regions where forests are cleared for agriculture or urban expansion. But these years, there’s been more awareness about the issue, and the government has started taking steps to combat deforestation, like promoting reforestation projects and stricter regulations on land use.\n327. Is the government doing enough to protect the environment? Well, I think the government is making progress, but there’s still a long way to go. They’ve introduced some policies to protect the environment, like promoting clean energy, reducing pollution, and improving waste management. But sometimes enforcement can be inconsistent, especially with issues like illegal dumping or industrial pollution. I believe more needs to be done in terms of stricter regulations and raising awareness among the public.\n328. Which is more important, increasing the standard of living or protecting the environment? Well, I think both are important, but it’s about finding a balance. Increasing the standard of living is essential for improving people’s quality of life. But protecting the environment is just as crucial because, without a healthy environment, long-term improvements in living standards will be unsustainable.\n329. Who is responsible for protecting the environment, individuals or governments? Well, I think it’s a shared responsibility between both individuals and governments. But the government shares more responsibility. Because in China, we have a strong emphasis on collectivitism and the government plays a significant role in setting policies and enforcing environmental regulations.\n330. Are governments tough enough on companies which break environmental laws? Well, in China, there have been improvements in recent years, especially with stricter regulations and penalties for violations. But some companies still manage to bypass regulations, particularly in regions where economic development is prioritized. So I think the government could be tougher on companies that break environmental laws.\n331-340 331. What’s the difference between news from the radio and that from TV? Well, radio news relies purely on audio, so it’s more about the voice, tone, and sound effects to convey the story, you have to pay close attention to the details. It’s more focused on the narrative and can be easier to listen to on the go. But TV news often use both audio and visuals, to make the story more engaging and help you understand it better.\n332. Do you think people will become more or less healthy in the future? I’d say it depends. For people who value their health, they’ll likely become healthier in the future, especially with more awareness and resources available. But for others who have poor diets or unhealthy habits, their health might decline.\n333. What role does the media play? The media plays a significant role in shaping public opinion and influencing behavior. It can educate people through news, documentaries, and social media platforms. At the same time, it can shape perceptions by focusing on specific topics, which influences how we view issues or people. So, it’s a double-edged sword—it can inform and educate, but it can also manipulate.\n334. How can the media influence young people? Well, social media can shape young people’s views and behaviors. On the positive side, the media can empower them by raising awareness about important social issues and promoting positive values. On the negative side, it can create pressure to conform to unrealistic beauty standards or lead to constant comparisons with others.\n335. To what extent should we trust the media? We should be cautious about the media. Sometimes media can be a valuable source of information. But news can be influenced by various factors, like political agendas or commercial interests. So it’s important to recognize that not all media outlets are objective or free from bias.\n336. What news must people know about? What do they not need to know? Well, I think people should stay informed about news that affects their daily lives, such as health updates and environmental issues. But the sensational stories or celebrity gossip might be entertainment, but they don’t impact people’s daily lives, so people doesn’t need to pay too much attention to these topics.\n337. Do you ever play computer games? Well, back in my school days, I did enjoying playing computer games, it’s a fun way to relax and unwind. But now I’m working, I’m busier and prefer running to unplug from life.\n338. Are computers expensive in your country? Well, it depends on the brand and hardware configurations. International brands like Apple tend to have higher prices due to import taxes and brand premiums. High-end computers are more expensive, but there are more affordable options available from local brands like Lenovo.\n339. Do you have a camera? What kind? Well, I don’t have a camera. Actually, I don’t really get into photography. When I do take pictures, I usually just use my iPhone, it works well for casual shots.\n340. When and why do you take photos? Well, I take photos when I want to capture a memory, like at a family gathering. It’s not so much about taking perfect photos, but more about preserving moments that might slip away. I also take selfies during the Lunar New Year to capture the changes in my appearance over time.\n341-350 341. Are digital cameras better than cameras with film? Well, I would say it depends. Digital cameras are more convenient for everyday use because you can instantly see your shots and delete unwanted photos. Film cameras have a certain charm and nostalgia. The process of using film makes each shot feel more meaningful, and many people appreciate the unique quality of film photos.\n342. Why are mobile phones so popular? Mobile phones are so popular because they offer a ton of convenience. Smart phones are like mini computers, allowing us to browse the internet, check social media, and take photos on the go. They also keep us connected to friends and family through messaging and video call. Also, with features like GPS and online shopping, they’ve become essential tools for everyday life.\n343. Aside mobile phones, what other forms of communication do you use? Well, aside from mobile phones, I also use email and messaging apps like WeChat to stay in touch with people. For work, I usually use email to communicate with my colleagues, while for family and friends, I prefer WeChat. I also use social media platforms like Instagram to connect with people I’m interested in.\n344. What does your mobile phone look like? My phone is an iPhone 11. It’s black and has a sleek, simple design. The back features a dual-camera setup. It’s not too big, so it fits comfortably in my hand. The screen is clear and vibrant, and the overall look is quite minimalistic.\n345. Do you prefer sending a text message or talking on your mobile? I would say it depends. When I’m communicating with my boss, I prefer sending messages because it gives me time to consider the content. But for friends or family, I prefer talking on the phone or making video calls on messaging apps.\n346. What do you use the Internet for? Well, I use the internet for a variety of things. As a software engineer, I mostly use it for coding and collaborating with colleagues. I also use it for reading articles and occasionally keeping up with social media. Plus, it’s my go-to for learning new things, whether it’s watching online courses, reading tutorials, or browsing interesting topics.\n347. Have you ever bought anything from the Internet? Yeah, I’ve bought quite a few things from the internet. In China, the delivery service is really advanced. I mostly shop for food, clothes, and tech gadgets. Shopping online saves me the hassle of going to physical stores, and it’s super convenient.\n348. Do you think you spend too much time on the net? Well, I would say no. As a software engineer, I need to use the internet for work. But I’m not really into social media because it tends to take up a lot of time once you start using it—it’s like a rabbit hole, and it’s not productive.\n349. Have you ever been the member of a sports team? Well, When I was in school, I’ve never been a member of a sports team, but I do love sports and participated in running competitions. I also enjoyed playing football on weekend to clear my mind.\n350. Do you prefer to watch sporting events live or on TV? Well, I prefer watching sporting events on TV. It’s more comfortable since I can watch from home, and I get to enjoy the commentary and replays. I can also pause or rewind if I miss something. But I think watching live events would be amzing for the atmosphere and excitement, but it’s just not always practical.\n351-360 351. Do you prefer team or individual sports? Well, I prefer team sports, and I am a big fan of football, my favorite football team is Liverpool. I’ve been supporting them for several years. Watching their matches is always exciting and I really admire their style of play, attacking football fastly with a lot of intensity.\n352. What’s the most dangerous sport you’ve played? Well, I’m not really into dangerous sports, I prefer more relaxing sports like jogging. But a friend of mine loves bungee jumping. You jump off a high platform with a bungee cord tied to your ankles. You free-fall for a few seconds before the cord stretches and snaps you back up. It’s generally safe, but personally, I’m not a fan of it.\n353. Who is a famous sports person from your country? One famous sports person from China is Yao Ming. He’s a retired professional basketball player who played in the NBA for the Houston Rockets. Yao Ming is known for his incredible skill on the court. He helped raise the profile of the sport in the country and was a huge inspiration for many aspiring athletes.\n354. Which sport do you not like to watch or play? Well, I’m not really a fan of golf. I find it a bit too slow-paced, and honestly, it’s just not my thing. I prefer sports that are more dynamic and fast-paced like football. Golf requires a lot of patience, and I guess I’m just more into things that get my adrenaline going.\n355. Would you agree that sports star earn too much money? Well, it’s hard to say, to be honest. Sports star work really hard, and their training involve a lot of pressure and long hours. But at the same time, I think the money they make is often way higher than most people earn.\n356. What are the effects of parents who become too involved in their children’s sports activities? Well, I think it has both pros and cons. On the positive side, parents’ care can boost their kids’ confidence. But, if the involvement goes too far, it can lead to pressure, and kids might feel like they’re not playing for fun anymore but to meet their parents’ expectations.\n357. What responsibilities do sports stars have to society? I think sports stars have a responsibility to set a good example, especially for youngsters. Because their actions can influence how yonger generations think and behave. They can use their platform to make a positive difference.\n358. Has sport become too commercialised these days? Yeah, I think sports have become too commertialised these years. Sponsorships and advertising are a huge part of the industry now, which is great for making the sport financially sustainable, but sometimes it feels like the focus is shifting more towards making money than on the game itself.\n359. Do you think would sporting events, like the Olympics, promote international understanding? Absolutely. They bring people from all over the world together, showcasing different cultures, values, and traditions. It provides an opportunity for countries to put aside their difference and focus on common ground, helping people feel more connected across borders.\n360. Do you think gambling on sporting events is acceptable? Well, I think gambling on sporting events is a bit of gray area. On one hand, it’s legal in many places and add excitement for fans. But it can also lead to addiction and financial issues, especially if people start betting more than they can afford to lose. Plus, it has the potential to affect the integrity of the sport, with issues like match-fixing.\n361-370 361. What should be the punishment for sports people who take performance-enhancing drugs? Well, I believe atheletes who use performance-enhancing drugs should face suspension or a competition ban, as it undermines the spirit of fair play. It’s not only unfair to other competitors but also sends a wrong message to fans, especially those who look up to these athletes.\n362. What does your government do to encourage people to lead a healthy lifestyle? Well, firstly, the government encourages physical activity through infrastructure, like building more parks and sports facilities in cities. They also run campaigns to raise aweness about the importance of exercise, balanced diets, and regular health checkups.\n363. How do you think sports and exercise may develop in the future? Well, in the future, I think technolgy will likely play a big role in sports and exercise. People may wear technical devices to track heath metrics in real-time. Virtual reality could also bring new ways to experience sports, making training and exercise more immersive.\n364. What are the benefits of having sports as part of the school curriculum? Well, firstly, it helps students stay physically active, which is important for their overall health. Regular exercise can also improve things like concentration, memory, and even academic performance. Plus, Sports teach life skills like teamwork, displine, and perseverance, which can be useful both in and out of the classroom.\n365. Is it customary to tip at restaurants in your country? Well, in China, tipping is not customary at restaurants, and it’s generally not expected. In fact, people tend to expect good service without the need for extra payment. But in some higher-end restaurants, service charges are sometimes included in the bill, but it’s not very common.\n366. Who usually pays for the meal when going out to eat in your country? Well, in China, it’s quite common for the person who invited others to eat to pay for the meal, especially in business or family settings. The host typically takes on the responsibility, as it’s seen as a gesture of hospitality. But among friends, it’s more common that everyone pays their share, or one person might pay and others will take turns next time.\n367. What do you think of health food? Well, I think health food is great way to support overall well-being. There’s a saying in England, ‘You are what you eat,’ and I totally agree. Foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean proteins can improve digestion, energy levels, and even mood.\n368. Do you like food from other countries? Yeah, I really enjoy other countries! I think trying different cuisines is a fun way to experience new flavors and cultures. I’ve tried Japanese Sushi, it’s delicious—fresh fish, perfect rice, and soy sauce. I love how each piece is so simple but packed with taste.\n369. Do you often eat snacks between meals? Well, I eat really healthily, I don’t eat snacks between meals very often. But sometimes I’ll have somthing light if I’m hungry, and I usually prefer healthier options, like fruits and nuts.\n370. Have you ever had food poisoning? Yeah. There was a time when I visited my grandma during Lunar New Year, and I drank some fresh orange juce, and things took an awkward turn. The oranges were fresh, but I think the water might not have been clean.\n371-380 371. Would you agree that people eat more healthily than in the past? Well, I would say it depends. Some people are becoming more aware of healthy eating. There’s a lot more information available about nutrition and people are paying more attention to what they eat. But for those who enjoy junk food, like processed foods and sugary beverages, I think they’re eating less healthily compared to the past. But overall, I’d say people are eating more healthily than before.\n372. How important is it to you to have a balanced diet? Well, I eat really healthily, and I think having a balanced diet is pretty important to me. For breakfast, I usually have whole grains, dried berries, nuts, milk, and supplements like Vitamin D and probiotics. For lunch and dinner, I enjoy protein-rich foods like beef, eggs, and salmon. Of course, I don’t always stick to it perfectly, especially when eating out with family or friends.\n373. What are the main differences between Asian and Western food? The main differences between Asian and Western food lie in ingredients, cooking styles, and flavors. In asian cuisine, there’s often a focus on rice, noodles, and fresh vegetables, with ingredients like soy sauce, ginger, garlic, and a variety of spices. The flavors tend to be more umami, with a balance of salty, sweet, sour, and spicy. As far as I know, western food often includes more meat-heavy dishes, like steaks or burgers, and uses ingredients like potatoes, bread, and dairy.\n374. What significance does food have in your culture? Well, food holds a lot of significance in Chinese culture. It’s not just about nourishment; it’s deeply tied to traditions and celebrations. Certain dishes symbolize good luck and prosperity. For example, dumplings are often eaten during Lunar New Year for wealth, and fish represents abundance.\n375. Do some cultures have a healthier diet than others? Yeah, some cultures have a healthier diet than others, often due to locally available ingredients. For example, Mediterranean diets, which focus on whole grains, vegetables, fruits, olive oil, and fish, which is rich in healthy animal fat like Omega-3.\n376. How often do you have a health check-up? Well, I try to get a health check-up once a year, just to make sure everything is in order. It’s a good way to catch any potential issues early and stay on top of my health.\n377. Are gyms and health spas popular in your country? Yeah, gyms and health spas have become quite popular in China, especially in bigger cities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen. As people are becoming more health-conscious, many are joining gyms to stay fit or work out regularly.\n378. Are you afraid of dentists? Well, I would say no. Actually, I have never been to see a dentist. But I did have an uncomfortable experience in the past, I know the toothache is really terrible and I always make sure to take care of my teeth.\n379. Have you ever tried traditional Chinese medicine? Yeah, I’ve tried traditional Chinese medicine a few times. I’ve used herbal remedies for mild aches. I found the traditional Chinese medicine is interesting, it focuses on balancing the body’s energy, or “Qi,” and treating the root causes of ailments, not just the symptoms.\n380. Do you prefer western or natural medicine? Well, I would say it depends. For mild issues, I prefer traditional Chinese herbal remedies, I think it’s great for prevention and supporting the body in a more holistic way. But for serious health issues or emergencies, I dedinitely trust Western medicine, as it’s more research-driven and effective.\n381-390 381. How do you deal with stress? Well, Regarding stress management, I have my own methods. I enjoy jogging or walking around the city on weekends. Besides, meditation is also my daily routine, I meditate 15 minutes each day before bedtime to clear my mind and relax my body. When I feel overwhelmed, I like to listen to music, watch movies, and read books. I also call my family for support when I’m feeling stressed.\n382. How do you relaxed after work or studying? Well, after work or studying, I like to relax by watching a movie or listening to music. If the weather is nice, I might go for a run or take a walk around the city. I also enjoy hanging out with friends, whether it’s grabbing a bite at a restaurant or catching a movie together.\n383. Where is the best place to go to relax in your town/city? Well, in Shenzhen, the best place to relax has to be Shenzhen Bay Park. It’s a beautiful spot where you can enjoy the lovely view of the water and the skyline. It’s a great place to clear your mind and enjoy some peace away from the hustle and bustle of the city.\n384. Do you have enough relaxation time? Well, I try to make time for relaxation, but it can be a bit challenging sometimes, especially when work gets busy. I do my best to balance everything by setting aside moments for downtime, like taking a quick walk, watching something light, or just chilling with music.\n385. Have you ever broken a bone? Yeah, I broke my right hand once when I was younger. I was riding my bike and took a pretty hard fall. It wasn’t too serious, but I had to wear a cast for a few weeks. During that period, I actually learned how to use chopsticks with my left hand, which was a fun challenge.\n386. Who looks after you when you are sick? When I’m sick, my family usually takes care of me. They make sure I’m comfortable, bring me food, and sometimes give me medicine if needed. It’s nice to have that support when you’re not feeling your best.\n387. Do you often take days off sick from work or studies? I don’t get sick very often, and I don’t usually take days off sick from work unless I’m really not feeling well. I try to push through when I can, but if it’s something serious, I’ll definitely take a day to rest and recover. I think it’s important to listen to your body, so I don’t mind taking a sick day if I need it.\n388. What is traditional remedy for a cold in your culture? Well, in China, a traditional remedy for a cold often involves drinking hot ginger tea with honey. Ginger is believed to help warm the body, while honey soothes the throat. Some people also drink a bowl of warm, savory soup, like chicken or lean pork soup, which is thought to boost immunity and help with recovery. Additionally, herbal teas made from ingredients like chrysanthemum or mint are commonly used to clear the nose and ease symptoms.\n389 Describe an unhealthy habit you have. Well, one unhealthy habit I have is occasionally sleeping in, especially when I stay up late the night before. It messes up my sleep schedule, and I end up feeling sluggish for the rest of the day. Even though I know it’s better to stick to a consistent routine, sometimes I just end up hitting snooze a few too many times. It’s something I’m working on, as I know it affects my energy and productivity.\n390. What responsibilities do doctors have? Well, firstly, doctors need to listen to patients, understand their symptoms, and perform necessary tests to determine the cause of health issues. They also prescribe medications or treatments, and give advice on healthy lifestyle choices. Additionally, they have to maintain patient confidentiality and keep accurate medical records.\n391-400 391. What is the role of the government in healthcare? Well, the government manages public health systems, regulates healthcare services, and creates policies that promote public health. They also responsible for setting healthcare standards, ensuring safety and quality, and addressing health disparities. Additionally, they provide health insurance or subsidies to help people afford medical care.\n392. Do you agree that doctors are underpaid? Well, I would say it depends. In some places, doctors are well-compensated for their work. But in regions where there’s a shortage of healthcare professionals, doctors may feel underpaid relative to the amount of work they have.\n393. How has the media contributed to globalisation? Well, nowadays, our world is a digital one. We can use social media to connect with people from all over the world. Through the media, we can learn from each other and share ideas. The media also promotes international business, tourism, and cultural exchange, making it easier for people to access different ideas and experiences.\n394. Would you travel back to a place you have been to before and stay there again? Well, actually, I’ve never revisited a place, but I’d like to try it. It sounds interesting. It’s nice to go back to places that left a positive impression on you—it makes you feel both nostalgic and excited at the same time.\n395. Do you have a driver’s licence? Well, I don’t have a driver’s license, and I don’t plan to get one. In China, public transportation is really convenient, and taking it is more eco-friendly. Plus, I believe autonomous vehicles will become more popular in the future, and I’m just not that interested in cars, so I don’t feel the need to drive.\n396. What is the most popular form of public transportation in your town/city? In Shenzhen, the most popular form of public transportation is the subway. It’s fast, convenient, and connects almost major part of the city, making it the go-to choice for daily commuters. The subway system is well-developed, clean, and affordable. During peak hours, it can get crowded, but it’s still one of the most efficient ways to travel in the city.\n397. What mode of transportation do you think is the safest? Well, I would say the subway. Because the stations are typically equipped with safety features like emergency exits and surveillance cameras. Additionally, it’s usually well-regulated and it’s underground, there’s less risk of accidents compared to cars and buses.\n398. What is interesting/special about your culture? Well, I would say the food culture. Because it’s diverse, with each region offering unique flavors and dishes. From spicy Sichuan cuisine to the delicate dim sum of Guangdong, there’s always something new to try.\n399. What don’t you like about your culture? Well, one thing I don’t particularly like about my culture is the pressure to constantly work hard and achieve success, which can sometimes lead to burnout. There’s a strong emphasis on academic performance and career success. I think ambition is great, but it can sometimes make it diffiuclt to maintain a healthy work-life balance.\n400. How can the government attract more tourists to your country? Well, to attract more tourists, the government can focus on improving infrastructure, such as modernizing airports and public transportation, making travel easier and more convenient. They could also offer visa-free access to more countries to simplify the process for tourists.\n",

<blockquote>
<p>When choosing a university, people often consider the shcool&rsquo;s reputation and its strengths in specific fields. They also think about the location of the university. In China, many people prefer universities in big cities like Beijing, Shanghai or Shenzhen because these cities offer more job opportunities after graduation, and they often plan their career paths around staying these major hubs.</p>

<p>Well, in fields like technology, finance, or medicine, tertiary education is often a basic requirement in job hunting. Because it shows you have specialized knowledge and competence for the job. But, in recent years, there&rsquo;s growing focus on skills and practical experience, especially in industries like IT.</p>

<p>Well, it&rsquo;s quite true, especially in computer science, if you want to work in the Internet field, then you have to get your hands dirty. I think experience can help you understand things on a deeper level because you&rsquo;re dealing with challenges, making mistakes, and figuring out how to solve problems.</p>

<p>Yeah, my hometown is a pretty safe city. The crime rate is relatively low, and people generally feel comfortable walking around, even at night. Surveillance cameras are everywhere, where helps reduce theft, and the mobile payment is so popular in China that robberies have almost disppeared. But in some rural areas, there are still occasional cases of farm animals being stolen.</p>

<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s generally safe to walk outside alone at night in my city. The streets are well-lit, and surveillance cameras are everywhere. But, in recent years, the economic situation hasn&rsquo;t been very well, there are some isolated cases of unemployed indiciduals causing trouble out of frustration, but these incidents are extremely rare.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, blue-collar crime usually involves physical actions like theft or burglary, while white-collar crime is more about financial offenses, like fraud or insider trading. They are both harmful, but blue-collar crimes are typically easier to spot, while white-collar crimes can be more complex and harder to detect.</p>

<p>Well, I think abortion is a crime because there are ways to prevent unwanted pregnancies, like using contraception. If an unexpected preganancy happens, I see it as gift from God.

<blockquote>
<p>Well, I think it has both pros and cons. On the positive side, parents&rsquo; care can boost their kids&rsquo; confidence. But, if the involvement goes too far, it can lead to pressure, and kids might feel like they&rsquo;re not playing for fun anymore but to meet their parents&rsquo; expectations.</p>
