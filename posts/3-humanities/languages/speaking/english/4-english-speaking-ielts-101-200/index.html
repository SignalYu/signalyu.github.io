Well, actually, I seldom watch the news, to be honest. Because I find a lot of it can be misleading and irrelavant to my daily life. But sometimes I read international news in English, because it helps improve my English reading comprehension.\n184. What don’t you like about the news? One thing I don’t like about the news is that it can sometimes be biased, focusing more on conflict than on facts. It can also be exaggerated just to grab attention.\n185. Should the media be censored? Well, I think the media should be regulated, but not heavily censored. It’s important to strike a balance between freedom of expression and ensuring that content is responsible. Everyone has the freedom to express their opinions, but there should be regulations in place to prevent the spread of misinformation, hate speech, or harmful content.\n186. Why does the media sensationalise the news? The media sensationalizes the news because it helps grab attention and boost readership. Sensationalism can increase engagement, drive traffic, and generate more revenue through ads.\n187. Describe a communication tool you use? Well, I use WeChat for daily communication. Strictly speaking, WeChat is not just a communication tool—it’s also a financial tool. Mobile payments are very advanced in China, so aside from communication, we also use WeChat for daily payments, topping up accounts, paying bills, and making transactions.\n188. Describe a memorable photo you have? One memorable photo I have is from a trip to the mountains with my granny. It was taken during a sunrise hike, and there’s a stunning view of the valleys. My granny passed away two years ago, and the photo always reminds me of the warm moments I shared with her.\n189. Describe an electronic device you would like to learn more about? Well, I would love to learn more about unmanned aerial vehicles, because they will have a wide range of applications in the future. I’m curious about how they are able to fly autonomously and carry out complex tasks. I’m also interested in how they will make delivery services more efficient.\n190. How will the Internet develop in the future? Well, in the future, with 5G or 6G technology, the internet connection will be faster and more reliable. The Internet of Things will grow, connecting more devices and making everyday objects smarter. Cybersecurity will also become increasingly important, as more personal data is shared online.\n191-200 191. What are the dangers of swimming at the beach? I think swimmer should be careful of strong currents, because they can quickly pull swimmers away form shore. Another concern is marine life, like jellyfish or sharks, which can be dangerous in some areas. Additionaly, the water quality can be a concern, especially near industrial areas, where polutants can affect health.\n192. How has globalisation affected your culture? Well, Globalization have affected our culture a lot. It have made our culture more diverse and open minded. We have access to global media, food, and fashion, which enriched our daily lives and broadened our perspectives.\n193. What food can’t you stand? I really can’t stand stinky tofu, a traditional food from Changsha. The smell is incredibly strong and overwhelming. Even though many people love it, I just can’t handle the aroma. It’s one of those foods that tends to divide people—either you love it or you can’t stand it!\n194. How often do you eat dinner with your family? Well, I live in Shenzhen for work, while my parents are in my hometown. During holidays, I usually return to my hometown and have dinner with my family.\n195. Describe a restaurant you like. One of my favorite restaurants serves traditional Chinese hotspot. It’s located in Futian, and the atmosphere is comfortable and inviting. I really enjoy their specialty, coconut stewed chicken. The chicken is tender and smooth, and the soup is sweet and delicious.\n196. Is child obesity a problem in your country? Yeah, child obesity is becoming an increasing concern in my country. With the rise of fast food and sugary drinks, many children are struggling with weight issues. Additionally, less physical activity and the increased use of electronic devices also contribute to child obesity.\n197. What do you do to stay healthy? Well, I eat really healthily, including plenty of fruits, vegetables, protein-rich meats and whole grains. I’m also a big fan of sports, back in my school days, I almost exercise every day, but now I’m working, I exercised less, usually two or three times a week. I sleep early, about 7 to 9 hours a night. Medidation is also my daily routine—I medidate 15 minutes before bedtime to clear my mind.\n198. What can the government do to improve health conditions for the elderly? Well, the government can provide better access to affordable healthcare services, such as regular check-ups and preventive care. The government can also support community programs that encourage physical activity and social engagement for the elderly.\n199. Which countries have you been to? Well, I haven’t been to any foreign countries. But I would like to go to Japan in the future. Actually, I have been learning Japanese recently. I’m really curious about Japanese culture. I also love watching Japanese manga and anime.\n200. Do you prefer to travel by bus, train, ship, plane or car? I prefer traveling by train because, while riding a train, you can enjoy the landscape along the journey. But on a plane, all you see are just the clouds. Additionally, compared to buses and cars, trains are a more eco-friendly option, helping to reduce my carbon footprint.\n",

<p>I believe the root of poverty is a lack of education. Because without proper education, people may struggle to find well-paying jobs, it will perpetuate the cycle of poverty.
