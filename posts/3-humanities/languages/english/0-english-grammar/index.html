I’m trying to work. Let’s go out now. It isn’t raining anymore. How’s your new job? Are you enjoying it? Describe actions or situations that are happening during the current period of time, even if they are not happening at the exact moment of speaking. It is often used with time expressions such as today, this week, this year, these days, at the moment. She is reading a new book these days. The company I work for isn’t doing well this year. Kate wants to work in Italy, so she’s learning Italian. Describe changes or developments that have started and are still in progress. It is commonly used with verbs that express change, such as get, become, change, improve, increase, rise, fall, grow, start, and begin. Is your English getting better? The population of the world is increasing very fast. At first I didn’t like my job, but I’m starting to enjoy it now. Describe definite plans or arrangements in the near future, usually with a future time expression. I am meeting my teacher tomorrow. They are leaving next week. She is starting a new job on Monday. Present Simple Used to talk about things in general. It describes actions or situations that happen all the time, repeatedly, or are always true. Nurses look after patients in hospitals. I usually go away at weekends. The earth goes round the sun. do and does are used to form questions and negative sentences (except with the verb be) I come from Canada. Where do you come from? He doesn’t eat meat. Rice doesn’t grow in cold climates. Used to say how often we do things. It is commonly used with adverbs and expressions of frequency, such as always, usually, often, sometimes, rarely, never, every day, once a week. I get up at 8 o’clock every morning. How often do you go to the dentist? Julie doesn’t drink tea very often. Robert usually goes away two or three times a year. Used for actions that are performed by saying something. In these cases, the action happens at the moment of speaking. Common verbs include: promise, suggest, apologize, advise, insist, agree, refuse. I promise I won’t be late. I suggest we leave eayly. I apologize for being late. I advise you to see a doctor. I agree with your opinion. I refuse to accept this offer. Present Continuous vs. Present Simple I always do is used to describe a regular habit or something that happens every time. While I’m always doing desceibes something that happens too often, often with a negative feeling. I always speak politely. (a normal habit) You are always complainting. (complains too much) You’re always looking at your phone. Don’t you have anything else to do? Some verbs are not normally used in the present continuous. Including like, want, need, prefer, know, realise, understand, recognise, believe, suppose, remember, mean, belong, fit, contain, consist, seem. I’m hungry. I want something to eat. (not I’m wanting) Do you understand what I mean? Anna doesn’t seem very happy right now. This book belongs to me. When ’think’ means ‘believe’ or ‘have an opinion’, the continuous form is not used. When think means consider, the continuous form is possible. I think Mary is Canadian, but I’m not sure. (Not I’m thinking) Nicky is thinking of giving up her job. (she is considering it) Verbs such as see, hear, smell, and taste normally use the present simple, not hte continuous. Do you see that man over there? The room smells. Let’s open a window. This soup doesn’t taste very good. I hear a stange noise. The present simple or present continuous can be used to describe how someone looks or feels now. However, when talking about habits or general situations, the present simple is used. You look tired. You’re looking tired. How do you feel now? How are you feeling now? I usually feel tired in the morning. (not I’m usually feeling) The form am/is/are being is used to describe how someone is behaving now, especially when this behaviour is temporary or unusual. I can’t understand why he’s being so selfish. He isn’t usually like that. (behaving selfishly now); He never thinks about other people. He’s very selfish. (he is selfish generally, not only now) The path is icy. Don’t slip. Don’t worry. I’m being very careful. (being careful temporarily); I don’t like to take risks. I’m a very careful person. (general description) The form am/is/are being is not normally used for physical states or conditions that are not controlled. Sam is ill. (not is being ill) Are you tired? (not are you being tired.)
