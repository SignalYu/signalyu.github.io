Network Devices Network Devices Local Area Network (LAN): A network that connects computers and devices within a limited geographical area, such as a home, office, or school. Wide Area Network (WAN): A network that spans a large geographical area, often connecting multiple LANs. Computer Network: A system of interconnected computers and devices that communicate and share resources. Node: Any device connected to a network, such as a computer, printer, or phone. Resources: Assets shared over a network, including hardware (e.g., printers, storage) and software (e.g., applications, files). Client-Server: A network model where clients request services or resources from servers. Switches Devices provide connectivity between devices in a local area network (LAN). Routers: Devices that provide connectivity between LANs or external network. Wireless Router: A device that provides wireless connectivity to a network, allowing devices to connect without physical cables. Network Firewall: A security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined security rules, protecting against unauthorized access. 3. Cables, Connectors, and Ports Ethernet: A widely used wired networking technology that connects devices in a LAN using cables such as twisted pair or fiber optics. It follows standards like IEEE 802.3. IEEE (Institude of Electrical and Electronics Engineers): An organization that defines networking standards, including Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) and Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11). Unshilded Twisted Pair (UTP) Cables: A type of Ethernet cable with twisted copper wire pairs that reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI). Common categories include Cat5e, Cat6e, and Cat6a. Shielded Twisted Pair (STP) Cables: A type of Ethernet cable that includes additional shieding to protect against electromagnetic interference (EMI) and crosstalk (an interference caused by signal leakage between adjacent cables or wire pairs in a network). UTP Cables vs. STP Cables Electromagnetic Interference (EMI): Disruptions in signal transmission caused by external electromagnetic sources, such as power lines or other electronic devices. Shielded cables (STP) help reduce EMI. 8 Position 8 Contact (8P8C) Connector: The standard modular connector used for Ethernet cables, often incorrectly called an RJ45 connector. 8P8C vs. RJ45 Fiber Optic Cables: High-speed network cables that use light instead of electrical signals, offering faster speeds and resistance to EMI. Fiber Optic Cable Structure Single Mode Fiber (SMF): A fiber optic cable type designed for long-distance transimission using a single light beam, reducing signal loss and allowing for higher speeds. Multimode Fiber (MMF): A fiber optic cable type that carries multiple light beams, suitable for shorter distances due to higher dispersion. Single Mode vs. Multimode 4. Networking Models Networking models are conceptual models that define how different layers of a network should interact to achieve communication between devices. The two most common models are the OSI Model and the TCP/IP Model.\nThe OSI Reference Model The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a conceptual framework that divides network communication into seven layers. These layers are the Physical Layer, Data Link Layer, Network Layer, Transport Layer, Session Layer, Presentation Layer, and Application Layer. Each layer has a specific function and interacts with adjacent layers to ensure smooth and efficient data transmission.\nPhysical Layer: Transmits raw bits over a physical medium (e.g., cables). Data Link Layer: Handles data frames and ensures error-free transmission between adjacent nodes (e.g., MAC addresses, switches). Network Layer: Determines the best path for data and handles addressing and routing (e.g., IP addresses, routers). Transport Layer: Ensures reliable data transfer with error correction and flow control (e.g., TCP, UDP). Session Layer: Manages and controls communication sessions between applications. Presentation Layer: Converts data formats for compatibility (e.g., encryption, compression). Application Layer: Provides network services directly to applications (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SMTP). OSI Reference Model OSI Reference Model The TCP/IP Model The TCP/IP Model (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a practical framework used for internet communication. It consists of four layers: the Network Interface Layer, Internet Layer, Transport Layer, and Application Layer.\nNetwork Interface Layer: Handles physical data transmission over a network medium. It is equivalent to the Physical and Data Link Layers of the OSI model. Internet Layer: Routes packets across networks using IP addresses, similar to the Network Layer in the OSI model. Transport Layer: Ensures reliable (TCP) or fast (UDP) data delivery between devices, corresponding to the Transport Layer in the OSI model. Application Layer: Supports network applications and protocols like HTTP, FTP, and SMTP. It combines the functions of the Application, Presentation, and Session Layers in the OSI model. TCP/IP Model The 5-Layer Network Model The 5-Layer Network Model is a simplified version of the OSI Reference Model, commonly used to understand networking concepts. It merges the Session, Presentation, and Application Layers of the OSI model into a single Application Layer. Below is the diagram illustrating this model:\nThe 5-Layer Network Model Key Notes In networking, adjacent layer interaction refers to the communication and collaboration between two neighboring layers in a networking mo. Each layer provides service to the layer above it and relies on the layer below it to perform its functions. 5. The Cisco ISO CLI EXEC, Privileged EXEC, and Global Configuration Modes In Cisco devices (such as routers and switches), there are three main modes that allow interaction with the device: EXEC, Privileged EXEC, and Global Configuration modes.\nEXEC, Privileged EXEC, and Global Configuration Modes EXEC Mode: This is the initial mode when first logging into a Cisco device. It provides basic access to the device and allows running simple monitoring and diagnostic commands. Privileged EXEC Mode: This mode provides more advanced commands to view detailed information about the device. TO enter Privileged EXEC Mode, type enable from EXEC Mode. TO exit Privileged EXEC Mode, type disable to return to EXEC Mode. Global Configuration Mode: This mode allows modification of the system configuration. To Global Configuration Mode, type configure terminal or conf t (shorthand). To return to Privileged EXEC Mode, type end or exit. 6. Ethernet LAN Switching Ethernet Frame Format An Ethernet frame is the fundamental unit of data transmission in Ethernet networks. It is used to encapsulate and transmit data over a Local Area Network (LAN). The Ethernet frame format is defined by the IEEE 802.3 standard and consists of several fields. Here is a detailed breakdown of the Ethernet frame format:\nEthernet Frame Format Preamble (7 bytes): A series f alternating 1s and 0s used for synchonization. SFD (Start Frame Delimiter, 1 byte): Uses a one byte bit pattern (10101011) to mark the end of the preamble and the start of the actual data. Destination MAC Address (6 bytes): The MAC address of the device receiving the frame. Source MAC Address (6 bytes): The MAC address of the device sending the frame. EtherType/Length (2 bytes): Indicates the type of protocol (e.g., IPv4, ARP) or the length of the payload. Payload/Data (46 - 1500 bytes): The actual data being transmitted, such as an IP packet or other protocol data. FCS (Frame Check Sequence, 4 bytes): A 32-bit CRC (Cyclic Redundency Check) for error detection. Note that the Ethernet header includes the Destination MAC Address, Source MAC Address, and Type/Length fields. It does not include the Preamble and Start Frame Delimiter (SFD) fields. The Ethernet trailer only includes the Frame Check Sequence (FCS) field.\nMAC Address A MAC address (Media Access Control Address) is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for communication on a network. It is a 6-byte address, typically represented in hexadecimal format. The MAC address is divided into two parts: OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier) and NIC (Network Interface Controller) Specific. The OUI is assigned by the IEEE to identify the manufacturer or vendor of the device, while the NIC Specific part is assigned by the manufacturer to uniquely identify the network interface device.\nMAC Address Format ",

<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model</strong> is a <em>conceptual framework</em> that divides network communication into seven layers. These layers are the <strong>Physical Layer</strong>, <strong>Data Link Layer</strong>, <strong>Network Layer</strong>, <strong>Transport Layer</strong>, <strong>Session Layer</strong>, <strong>Presentation Layer</strong>, and <strong>Application Layer</strong>. Each layer has a specific function and interacts with adjacent layers to ensure smooth and efficient data transmission.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>Physical Layer</strong>: Transmits raw bits over a physical medium (e.g., cables).</li>
<li><strong>Data Link Layer</strong>: Handles data frames and ensures error-free transmission between adjacent nodes (e.g., MAC addresses, switches).</li>
<li><strong>Network Layer</strong>: Determines the best path for data and handles addressing and routing (e.g., IP addresses, routers).</li>
<li><strong>Transport Layer</strong>: Ensures reliable data transfer with error correction and flow control (e.g., TCP, UDP).</li>
<li><strong>Session Layer</strong>: Manages and controls communication sessions between applications.</li>
<li><strong>Presentation Layer</strong>: Converts data formats for compatibility (e.g., encryption, compression).</li>
<li><strong>Application Layer</strong>: Provides network services directly to applications (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SMTP).</li>

<ol>
<li><strong>Network Interface Layer</strong>: Handles physical data transmission over a network medium. It is equivalent to the <strong>Physical</strong> and <strong>Data Link Layers</strong> of the OSI model.</li>
<li><strong>Internet Layer</strong>: Routes packets across networks using IP addresses, similar to the <strong>Network Layer</strong> in the OSI model.</li>
<li><strong>Transport Layer</strong>: Ensures reliable (TCP) or fast (UDP) data delivery between devices, corresponding to the <strong>Transport Layer</strong> in the OSI model.</li>
<li><strong>Application Layer</strong>: Supports network applications and protocols like HTTP, FTP, and SMTP. It combines the functions of the <strong>Application</strong>, <strong>Presentation</strong>, and <strong>Session Layers</strong> in the OSI model.</li>

<li><strong>Destination MAC Address (6 bytes)</strong>: The MAC address of the device receiving the frame.</li>
<li><strong>Source MAC Address (6 bytes)</strong>: The MAC address of the device sending the frame.</li>
<li><strong>EtherType/Length (2 bytes)</strong>: Indicates the type of protocol (e.g., IPv4, ARP) or the length of the payload.</li>
<li><strong>Payload/Data (46 - 1500 bytes)</strong>: The actual data being transmitted, such as an IP packet or other protocol data.</li>
<li><strong>FCS (Frame Check Sequence, 4 bytes)</strong>: A 32-bit CRC (Cyclic Redundency Check) for error detection.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>A <strong>MAC address (Media Access Control Address)</strong> is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for communication on a network. It is a 6-byte address, typically represented in hexadecimal format. The MAC address is divided into two parts: <strong>OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier)</strong> and <strong>NIC (Network Interface Controller) Specific</strong>. The OUI is assigned by the IEEE to identify the manufacturer or vendor of the device, while the NIC Specific part is assigned by the manufacturer to uniquely identify the network interface device.</p>
