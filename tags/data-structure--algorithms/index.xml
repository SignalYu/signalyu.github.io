      <description>Simple Two Pointers The Simple Two Pointers technique is commonly used to solve problems involving sorted array, where a set of elements needs to be found that satisfy certain constrains. This approach is efficient in scenarios such as finding a pair that sums to a target or reversing an array or string. In the two simple two pointers technique, two pointers &amp;ndash; typically labeled &amp;ldquo;left&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; are initialized and move in a specific direction based on the problem&amp;rsquo;s requirements.</description>

      <description>Recursion Recursion is a programming technique where a function repeatedly calls itself until it reaches a base case, whcih stops the recursion and allows it to return a result. It is a way of breaking down complex problems into smaller, simpler subproblems that are eaiser to solve.
Head Recursion Head Recursion is a type of recursion where a function makes its recursive call first, immediately after checking the base case, and performs all other operations only after the recursive call returns.</description>
