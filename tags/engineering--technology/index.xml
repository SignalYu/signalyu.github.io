      <description>1. Solid Principle 1.1 Single Responsibility Principle A class should have only one reason to change, meaning each class should focus on a single functionality or responsibility.
SHOW CODE Single Responsibility Principle import java.io.IOException; import java.util.*; import java.util.regex.*; import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper; /** * 1. User class is only used to represent entity. * 2. UserValidator class is solely responsible for validating user objects. * 3. Store class is only used to manage user objects storage.</description>

      <description>Simple Two Pointers The Simple Two Pointers technique is commonly used to solve problems involving sorted array, where a set of elements needs to be found that satisfy certain constrains. This approach is efficient in scenarios such as finding a pair that sums to a target or reversing an array or string. In the two simple two pointers technique, two pointers &amp;ndash; typically labeled &amp;ldquo;left&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; are initialized and move in a specific direction based on the problem&amp;rsquo;s requirements.</description>

      <description>Introduction to Databases A database is a collection of data that is stored, managed, and accessed electronically. It typically contains one or more tables, which resemble Excel or Google sheets, with data organized into rows and columns. As the number of tables grows, managing the database can become complex, making it essential to design a scalable and maintainable strucutre.
Databases can be broadly categorized into two types: Relational database, primarily used for real-time data updates and transactions, and data warehouse, optimized for data analysis and reporting purposes.</description>

      <description>Recursion Recursion is a programming technique where a function repeatedly calls itself until it reaches a base case, whcih stops the recursion and allows it to return a result. It is a way of breaking down complex problems into smaller, simpler subproblems that are eaiser to solve.
Head Recursion Head Recursion is a type of recursion where a function makes its recursive call first, immediately after checking the base case, and performs all other operations only after the recursive call returns.</description>

      <description>JUnit assertEquals In JUnit, assertEquals is a method used to check if the expected value and the actual value are equal in unit tests.
SHOW CODE Java import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test; import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals; public class UnitTest { @Test void addition() { Calculator calculator = new Calculator(); int result = calculator.add(1, 1); assertEquals(2, result, &#34;The result of 1 + 1 should be 2&#34;); } } assertTure &amp;amp; assertFalse In JUnit, the assertTrue and the assertFalse methods are used to validate boolean expressions in unit tests.</description>

      <description>Synchronous Messaging VS. Asynchronous Messaging Synchronous Messaging and Asynchronous Messaging are two commnucation paradigms used in distributed systems. In synchronous messaging, the sender will not continue executing until it receives the acknowledged message from the receiver. This paradigm is commonly used in situations that require immediate feedback to continue operations, such as parments or transaction processing.
The advantages of this paradigm include ease of implementation and usefulness in situations where immediate feedback is needed.</description>

      <description>Introduction to DBMS A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that provides an interface for users to interact with databases. It enables the management, storage, and manipulation of data within databases. DBMS can be broadly classified into two main types: Relational DBMS and NoSQL DBMS.
In a Relational DBMS, data is stored in structured tables and is manipulated using SQL (Structured Query Language). Examples of relational DBMS inlcude MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL.</description>

      <description>Introduction to Multithreading Program, Process, and Thread A program is a static set of instructions that stores on a disk. A process is an instance of a program that is currently being executed by the operating system. A thread is a small unit of process that can be scheduled and executed by the operating system. In simpler terms, a program is the code, a process is the excution of the code, a thread is a unit of execution within a process.</description>

      <description>Introduction to System Design System Design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to fulfill specific business requirements, while ensuring scalability, maintainability, and performance.
Load Balancing In System Design, Load Balancing refers to the practice of distributing incoming network traffic or workload across multiple servers or resources to optimize resource use and ensure high availability.
Load Balancing To fullly leverage scalability and redundency, load balancing can occur at different layers: between user and the web server, between web server and an internal platform serve, between internal platform server and database as illustrated in the following image:</description>

      <description>Core Concepts Loose Coupling Loose Coupling is a design principle that aims to reduce the dependencies between components within a system.
Inversion of Control (IoC) Inversion of Control is a design principle where the control of object creation and lifecycle management is transferred from the application code to an external container or framework.
Dependency Injection (DI) Dependency Injection is a design pattern commonly used in object-oriented programming, where the dependecies of a class are provided externally rather than being created within the class itself.</description>

      <description>Virtual DOM A Virtual DOM is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the real DOM. Each Node in the Virtual DOM is represented as a plain JavaScript object with properties describing the element, its attributes, and its children. The Virtual DOM will be updated whenever an application&amp;rsquo;s state changes. It minimizes real DOM updates by batching changes and applying them through an optimized process. --- title: Virtual DOM --- graph TD B[&#34;</description>

      <description>Enum In Java, an enum (short for &amp;ldquo;enumeration&amp;rdquo;) is used to define a collection of constants, such as days of the week or months of the year. An enum provides a type-safe way to handle constant values, and it can be used in a switch statement or for comparison using ==. Compared to a final constant in Java, an enum can contain fields, methods, and constructors. The values() method is used to retrive all the constants in an enum, and the valueOf() method is used to convert a string into an enum constant.</description>
