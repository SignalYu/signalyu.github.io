      <description>Present Continuous (I am doing) Describe an action that is happening now. The action has started but has not finished at the time of speaking. Please don&amp;rsquo;t make so much noise. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to work. Let&amp;rsquo;s go out now. It isn&amp;rsquo;t raining anymore. How&amp;rsquo;s your new job? Are you enjoying it? Describe actions or situations that are happening during the current period of time, even if they are not happening at the exact moment of speaking.</description>
