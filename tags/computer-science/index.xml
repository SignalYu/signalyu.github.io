      <description>1. Solid Principle 1.1 Single Responsibility Principle A class should have only one reason to change, meaning each class should focus on a single functionality or responsibility.

      <description>Simple Two Pointers The Simple Two Pointers technique is commonly used to solve problems involving sorted array, where a set of elements needs to be found that satisfy certain constrains. This approach is efficient in scenarios such as finding a pair that sums to a target or reversing an array or string. In the two simple two pointers technique, two pointers &amp;ndash; typically labeled &amp;ldquo;left&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; are initialized and move in a specific direction based on the problem&amp;rsquo;s requirements.</description>

      <description>Synchronous Messaging VS. Asynchronous Messaging Synchronous Messaging and Asynchronous Messaging are two commnucation paradigms used in distributed systems. In synchronous messaging, the sender will not continue executing until it receives the acknowledged message from the receiver. This paradigm is commonly used in situations that require immediate feedback to continue operations, such as parments or transaction processing.
The advantages of this paradigm include ease of implementation and usefulness in situations where immediate feedback is needed.</description>
