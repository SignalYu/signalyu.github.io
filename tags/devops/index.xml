      <description>Introduction to Docker SHOW CONTENTS Docker was developed to address the challenges of software deployment across various environments by providing a lightweight, consistent, and portable solution. Prior to Docker, developers often faced issues like &amp;ldquo;it works on my machine, but not in production,&amp;rdquo; caused by inconsistencies in dependencies, libraries, and configurations. Docker resolves this by containerizing applications, ensuring they run uniformly across any infrastructure. Its primary goal is to simplify development, testing, and deployment by encapsulating applications and their dependencies into isolated, reproducible containers.</description>
